# 🐾 Cat-Inspired Professional Resume (LaTeX)

![Resume Preview](resume.png)

This project is a fully coded resume created in **LaTeX**, originally based on my real CV but adapted for a highly qualified cat (yes, really, because why not?). 
It’s a blend of:
- Professional ATS-friendly formatting with a touch of personality through colour accents
- Compact and clear sectioning for a lot of information
- Playful wording without losing elegance, easily adaptable to any professional profile

## ✨ Features
- **Clean design** – fits everything on 1 page, but can be extended to 2 pages if needed
- **ATS-friendly** – tested on multiple resume parsers, all content reads perfectly
- **Easily customizable** – change colours, fonts, sections, or layout
- **Fun demo** – demonstrates LaTeX skills while keeping things a little more memorable

## 📂 Files

💡 _Why a cat?_  
Because showcasing skills doesn’t have to be boring — and I really love cats.  
This template presents technical LaTeX knowledge in a way that also tells a story and makes the résumé-writing process less soul-crushing.
